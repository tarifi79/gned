          <h2>Understanding Mental Health Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            The relationship between settlement experiences and mental health is
            crucial for immigrants and refugees. Research has highlighted three
            major stressors: acculturation-related stress, economic uncertainty,
            and ethnic discrimination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acculturation stress includes the psychological impact of adapting
            to a new culture. Economic challenges often stem from
            underemployment and credential recognition issues, leading to
            financial insecurity. Ethnic discrimination can exacerbate feelings
            of isolation and affect mental health negatively.

          <h2>Public Health Recommendations</h2>
          <p>
            To improve mental health outcomes among immigrants, it is vital to
            adopt a holistic public health approach that includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhancing social support networks to reduce isolation.</li>
            <li>
              Increasing accessibility to mental health services that are
              culturally and linguistically appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrating mental health education within community and health
              services to address stigma and promote well-being.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Public health practitioners are encouraged to consider these factors
            when designing interventions to support immigrant communities
            effectively.
