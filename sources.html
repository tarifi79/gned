          <h2>Detailed Analysis of Stressors</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding the multifaceted stressors immigrants face is crucial
            for providing effective support. Each stressor, from language
            barriers to discrimination, plays a significant role in shaping the
            immigrant experience.

            <h3>Language and Communication Barriers</h3>
            <p>
              Difficulty in communicating in the local language can severely
              limit an immigrant's ability to interact socially, access
              services, and perform basic tasks. This barrier extends beyond
              simple miscommunications, often affecting job prospects and social
              integration.

            <h3>Employment and Economic Security</h3>
            <p>
              Securing employment that matches one's skills and qualifications
              can be frustrating due to local market demands, recognition of
              foreign qualifications, and discriminatory practices. This leads
              to economic stress and impacts self-esteem and social status.

            <h3>Discrimination and Social Exclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Experiencing discrimination or lack of acceptance can have
              profound effects on mental health. Whether it's subtle biases or
              overt racism, these experiences can erode self-worth and impede
              integration into the community.

            <h3>Case Study: Overcoming Language Barriers</h3>
            <p>
              "When I first arrived, not being able to communicate fluently in
              English made even simple tasks daunting. I felt isolated and
              stressed," explains J.D., an immigrant from Ghana. "Joining
              language classes offered by a local community center helped me not
              only improve my English but also connect with others facing
              similar challenges."

            <h3>Case Study: Credential Recognition Issues</h3>
            <p>
              R.O., a skilled mechanical engineer from India, shares his
              frustration: "Back home, I was part of major projects, but here,
              my qualifications were initially overlooked. It took two years and
              numerous certifications to finally get recognized in my field here
              in Canada. The process was incredibly disheartening and
              stressful."
