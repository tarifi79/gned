          <h2>Statistical Overview of Health Impacts</h2>
          <p>
            Detailed statistics that illustrate the health challenges faced by
            immigrants can help policymakers and community leaders better
            understand and address these issues.

            <h3>Mental Health Trends Among Immigrants</h3>
            <p>
              Recent studies indicate that 30% of immigrants report experiencing
              significant stress due to economic instability and job security,
              compared to 20% of native-born citizens. Moreover, immigrants are
              twice as likely to report feelings of social isolation, which
              significantly contributes to mental health issues.

            <h3>Health Outcomes Related to Acculturation Stress</h3>
            <p>
              Research highlights that within five years of resettlement, the
              initial health advantage seen in immigrants, known as the 'healthy
              immigrant effect,' begins to decline. Factors contributing to this
              decline include acculturation stress and difficulty accessing
              culturally sensitive healthcare services.

            <h3>Hypertension</h3>
            <p>
              Chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure, or hypertension,
              which heightens the risk of heart disease and stroke. Immigrants
              facing constant stressors may have an increased prevalence of
              hypertension due to ongoing emotional strain and lifestyle
              changes.

            <h3>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h3>
            <p>
              Continuous stress can result in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),
              characterized by extreme fatigue that doesn't improve with rest.
              Factors contributing to this condition include the significant
              effort required to adjust to a new culture and the demands of
              resettlement.

            <h3>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h3>
            <p>
              Uncertainty and the pressure to adapt can cause Generalized
              Anxiety Disorder (GAD), where individuals experience excessive
              worry about various aspects of their daily life, leading to a
              range of anxiety symptoms that disrupt day-to-day activities.

            <h3>Major Depressive Disorder</h3>
            <p>
              The loss of social networks, cultural dislocation, and financial
              concerns can trigger Major Depressive Disorder, a mood disorder
              that causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in
              previously enjoyed activities.
